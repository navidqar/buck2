However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n  --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n  --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nConsole Options:\n  --console <super|simple|...>\n          Which console to use for this command\n          \n          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]\n          [default: auto]\n          [possible values: auto, none, simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super]\n\n  --ui <UI>...\n          Configure additional superconsole ui components.\n          \n          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add.

No guarantees whatsoever are made\n          regarding the stability of the format\n\n  --command-report-path <PATH>\n          Write the command report to this path.
