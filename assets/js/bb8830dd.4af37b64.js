In the absence of\n          this argument, buck2 will use the target literals in your cquery expression as the value\n          for this argument, which may not be what you want.\n\n      --target-platforms <PLATFORM>\n          Configuration target (one) to use to configure targets\n\n  -m, --modifier <VALUE>\n          A configuration modifier to configure all targets on the command line.

However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n  --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n  --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nConsole Options:\n  --console <super|simple|...>\n          Which console to use for this command\n          \n          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]\n          [default: auto]\n          [possible values: auto, none, simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super]\n\n  --ui <UI>...\n          Configure additional superconsole ui components.\n          \n          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add.

Press 'h' for help when superconsole\n          is active.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - dice\n          - debugevents\n          - io:          I/O panel\n          - re:          RE panel\n\n  --no-interactive-console\n          Disable console interactions\n          \n          [env: BUCK_NO_INTERACTIVE_CONSOLE=]\n\nEvent Log Options:\n  --event-log <PATH>\n          Write events to this log file\n\n  --write-build-id <PATH>\n          Write command invocation id into this file\n\n  --unstable-write-invocation-record <PATH>\n          Write the invocation record (as JSON) to this path. No guarantees whatsoever are made\n          regarding the stability of the format\n\n  --command-report-path <PATH>\n          Write the command report to this path. A command report is always written to\n          `buck-out/v2/<uuid>/command_report` even without this flag\n\nStarlark Profiling Options:\n  --profile-mode <PROFILE_MODE>\n          Profile target loading.\n          \n          When this option is enabled, Buck will profile every `BUCK` file loaded during the query\n          and merge the results into a single profile. The command may return cached profile data if\n          `BUCK` files were not invalidated.\n          \n          [possible values: time-flame, heap-allocated, heap-retained, heap-flame-allocated,\n          heap-flame-retained, heap-summary-allocated, heap-summary-retained, statement, bytecode,\n          bytecode-pairs, typecheck, coverage, none]\n\n  --profile-output <PROFILE_OUTPUT>\n          Where to write profile output\n\nUniversal Options:\n  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>\n          How verbose buck should be while logging.\n          \n          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status.
