However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n  --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n  --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nEvent Log Options:\n  --event-log <PATH>\n          Write events to this log file\n\n  --write-build-id <PATH>\n          Write command invocation id into this file\n\n  --unstable-write-invocation-record <PATH>\n          Write the invocation record (as JSON) to this path. No guarantees whatsoever are made\n          regarding the stability of the format\n\n  --command-report-path <PATH>\n          Write the command report to this path. A command report is always written to\n          `buck-out/v2/<uuid>/command_report` even without this flag\n\nUniversal Options:\n  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>\n          How verbose buck should be while logging.\n          \n          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =\n          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;\n          \n          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,\n          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log.
