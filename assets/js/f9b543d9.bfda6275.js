This allows you to interact with the Buck2 daemon\nvia the `stdin` and `stdout` of this command: you send requests to the daemon by writing to `stdin`,\nand you get responses via `stdout`.\n\nThe protocol used by this command is length-prefixed protobuf. This format is a repeated series of a\nvarint followed by a record of the length indicated by said varint.\n\nThe protobuf spec for those records is described in `buck2_subscription_proto/subscription.proto`.\nThe client writes `SubscriptionRequest` and reads `SubscriptionResponse`. See the documentation in\n`subscription.proto` to discover available APIs.\n\nThis API does not (currently) allow invalid requests and will error out when one is sent.\n\nUsage: buck2-release subscribe [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n      --active-commands\n          Whether to request command snapshots\n\n      --unstable-json\n          Whether to get output as JSON. The JSON format is deemed unstable so this should only be\n          used for debugging\n\n  -h, --help\n          Print help (see a summary with '-h')\n\nBuckconfig Options:\n  -c, --config <SECTION.OPTION=VALUE>\n          List of config options\n\n      --config-file <PATH>\n          List of config file paths\n\n      --fake-host <HOST>\n          [possible values: default, linux, macos, windows]\n\n      --fake-arch <ARCH>\n          [possible values: default, aarch64, x8664]\n\n      --fake-xcode-version <VERSION-BUILD>\n          Value must be formatted as: version-build (e.g., 14.3.0-14C18 or 14.1-14B47b)\n\n      --reuse-current-config\n          Re-uses any `--config` values (inline or via modefiles) if there's a previous command,\n          otherwise the flag is ignored.\n          \n          If there is a previous command and `--reuse-current-config` is set, then the old config is\n          used, ignoring any overrides.\n          \n          If there is no previous command but the flag was set, then the flag is ignored, the\n          command behaves as if the flag was not set at all.\n\n      --exit-when-different-state\n          Used for exiting a concurrent command when a different state is detected\n\n      --preemptible <PREEMPTIBLE>\n          Used to configure when this command could be preempted by another command for the same\n          isolation dir.\n          \n          Normally, when you run two commands - from different terminals, say - buck2 will attempt\n          to run them in parallel. However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n  --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n  --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nEvent Log Options:\n  --event-log <PATH>\n          Write events to this log file\n\n  --write-build-id <PATH>\n          Write command invocation id into this file\n\n  --unstable-write-invocation-record <PATH>\n          Write the invocation record (as JSON) to this path. No guarantees whatsoever are made\n          regarding the stability of the format\n\n  --command-report-path <PATH>\n          Write the command report to this path. A command report is always written to\n          `buck-out/v2/<uuid>/command_report` even without this flag\n\nUniversal Options:\n  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>\n          How verbose buck should be while logging.\n          \n          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =\n          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;\n          \n          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,\n          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage\n          \"-v=1,stderr\"\n          \n          [default: 1]\n\n      --oncall <ONCALL>\n          The oncall executing this command\n\n      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>\n          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the\n          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend\n          datasets\n\n"})})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
